# Replay Mod
This mod works on the popular minecraft server [Hypixel](https://hypixel.net/) to add commands to help play games. In order to work, this mod requires [HypixelAPI](https://github.com/CoolSpy3/HypixelAPI).

 The full list of commands is as follows:<br/><br/>
`/pa` - Short for Play Again. Runs /play to play a new game (of whatever you're currently playing) <br/><br/>
`/whatgameisthis` / `/wgit` - Prints the name to pass to /play to play whatever game you're currently playing <br/><br/>
`/splay <command>` - This is for use with [Short Commands](https://github.com/CoolSpy3/ShortCommands.git). It will register a new short command to play the game you are currently playing using the given alias. <br/><br/>
